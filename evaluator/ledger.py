"""The public score record: what was measured, for which commit, and what it earned.

The evaluator runs on a rented GPU box. Its state -- who submitted what first, which results are
accepted, what each PR scored -- lived only on that disk, so returning the box would take the
frontier and the "who was first" evidence with it. After every pass the evaluator writes this
directory and pushes it to a repository of its own (evaluator/publish_ledger.py).

    <ledger>/
      README.md                        current frontier, regenerated each pass
      <epoch>/frontier.json            the ranking after the pass
      <epoch>/results/<pr>-<head>.json one write-once record per evaluated PR head
      <epoch>/observations/*.json      first-seen records, copied from the evaluator's own store
      <epoch>/accepted/<name>/*        artifacts of merged, frontier-moving results

Anyone can re-derive every score from `accepted/` and a result record:

    bittrellis frontier <ledger>/<epoch>/accepted <your artifact>

What never enters the ledger: the private holdout (only PASS/FAIL reaches a record), the evaluator's
secret, tokens, and the sandbox's contributed code.
